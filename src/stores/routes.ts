// Routes are matched from top to bottom. Make sure they are sequenced
// in the order of priority. It is generally best to sort them by pattern,
// prioritizing specific patterns over generic patterns (patterns with
// one or more parameters). For example:
//     /items
//     /items/:id
export const routes = [
    { name: 'home', pattern: '/' },
